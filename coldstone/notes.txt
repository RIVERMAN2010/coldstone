ResourcePool information:
 have resources contain a first and last pass value,
 first/last pass values are assigned during resource creation and either write/reads later on.
 The resource is considered free once the resource's last pass value is less than or equal to the current pass value.
 ResourcePool only tracks resources that are related to the render graph, so resources created outside of the render graph are not tracked here.

Mesh Generation:
 Meshes are created from MeshData by the MeshGenerator.
 MeshData contains the raw vertex/index data and the MeshGenerator is responsible for creating GPU resources from that data.
 Mesh itself is an API abstract class that is extended by API specific implementations (e.g. D3D12Mesh, VulkanMesh).
 Meshes are created outside of the render graph and are managed directly by the scene or other systems.
